The first thing I'd like to make my Vim IDe feel like an IDE is a sidebar on the right to browse the directory porject
source code. 

### Install pathogen

I choose `pathoden` to be my plugins manager since it's easy to install and manage plugins. So you have to install `pathogen` for `vim`. Follow this link to install `pathogen`: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#installation

### Install NERDTree

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone 
```

### Basic usage

|commands| Explain|
|--------|---------|
|o| Open file, directory|
|t| Open file in new tab|
|i| Open file in a horizontal split window|
|s| Open file in vertical split window|
|x| Close the current directory|
|q| Close the NERDTree|
